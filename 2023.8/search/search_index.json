You can access the webpage of Bgee in your browser by following this link.</p> <p>You will arrive at the Bgee homepage where you can access the various tools of Bgee in the top toolbar, directly search for a gene in the middle search box or download expression data for various animal species by clicking on the correct species picture in the bottom of the page. For this step, we will be interested in continuing to explore the function of <code>NCDN</code> orthologs, now focusing on their expression. To do this, you will just need to search for a gene name (<code>NCDN</code>), a UniProt or an Ensembl identifier.</p> <p>Doing this, you will be directed to the gene search result page where you can see that there are 49 genes in Bgee for the gene name <code>NCDN</code>.</p> <p>Question: Why are there multiple Ensembl identifiers for one gene name (<code>NCDN</code>)?</p> Answer <p>We can see that the gene names do not change (always <code>NCDN</code>), however there are multiple Ensembl identifiers because each one corresponds to the <code>NCDN</code> of a different species. Indeed, each Ensembl ID has prefixes identifying the species and feature type.</p> <p>In this page, you will notably find a column for <code>Gene identifier</code> that represents the unique Ensembl identifiers for each species or the species scientific and common name in the column <code>Organism</code>. To continue, please select a species (for example mouse) and click on their Ensembl ID (ENSMUSG00000028833). This will lead you to the mouse specific gene page for <code>NCDN</code>; don\u2019t worry you will still be able to see other orthologs of <code>NCDN</code>.</p> <p>On the left, you have the headers that allow you to jump easily to different sections of the page such as Expression or Orthologs. Since in this exercise we want to know where <code>NCDN</code> is expressed, we will primarily focus on the expression section for now.</p> <p>In this expression tab, you will find all anatomical entities where Bgee has evidence that this gene is expressed. You will notably find the expression score that denotes how strongly the gene was expressed in that tissue (from 0 to 100). If you want to verify the given information, you can also access the data used to determine expression in the link to source data column or see which type of data was used in source (such as R for bulk RNA-seq or A for Affymetrix microarray).</p> <p>Question: Looking at the top entries in the expression table, in which organ(s) do you think this gene is generally expressed?</p> Answer <p>We can see that the top three hits are CA3 field of hippocampus, CA3 field of hippocampus, perirhinal cortex. If we look at the next 10 hits, we also see that they are all tissues belonging to the brain. We can therefore suggest that this gene is expressed throughout the brain at really high levels (in the top 1% of most highly expressed genes in this region).</p> <p>We can also investigate if this gene is expressed at different stages of development. To do so, you can unselect <code>Anat. entity and cell types</code> and tick the <code>Dev. stage</code> box on top of the expression tab and update the results.</p> <p>Here, we see that this gene seems to be expressed in late adults as well as the embryonic stage (for example, <code>Theiler stage 04</code>). If you are unsure what a developmental stage term means, clicking on the identifier (e.g. <code>MmusDv:0000008</code>) will take you to the description of this term in the developmental ontology. Interestingly, in this case, looking at the <code>Reported absence of expression</code> section (below in the same page), we can see that there are no developmental stages where the gene is not expressed at all, even though its expression is much lower outside the brain.</p> <p>Questions:</p> <ul> <li>Go back to the <code>Expression</code> section and the <code>Anat. entity and cell types</code> filter. Where is <code>NCDN</code> the least expressed?</li> <li>Play around by combining the filters for sex, strain, developmental stage or anatomical entities, which insights can you gather?</li> </ul> Answer <ul> <li>We can see, for example, that <code>NCDN</code> has relatively low expression in renal tissue even though it is still expressed (expression score lower than 50)</li> <li>We can, for example, see that mouse strains C57BL/6 X CD-1 have a way lower expression overall of the <code>NCDN</code> gene than C57BL/6-Tyr c-Brd strains. We can also see that this gene is expressed throughout the life cycle of mice from embryonic stages to adulthood</li> </ul> <p>By clicking on the <code>Orthologs</code> section in the menu on the left or scrolling down to it, you can find the different orthologs for NCDN which are found in Bgee. This information is retrieved from the OMA SPARQL endpoint that you used on the first day. Orthologs for NCDN are found at 11 different taxon levels. You can see the Ensembl identifiers of orthologous genes at specific taxon levels by clicking the <code>See details</code> arrow.</p> <p>Question: Which is the higher taxon in which you can find human orthologs of mouse <code>NCDN</code>?</p> Answer <p>The Euarchontoglires taxon.</p> <p>Unfold the orthologs (<code>See details</code>) to find the human <code>NCDN</code>, and open its page in a new tab.</p> <p>Question: Does the function of <code>NCDN</code> seem to have been conserved between mouse and human? What about more distant species?</p> Answer <p>Looking at the <code>NCDN</code> gene in humans by finding it through the orthologs section, we can see that the <code>NCDN</code> gene is also highly expressed in the same tissues and at really similar levels of expression. We could therefore hypothesize that its function remained similar.</p> <p>Now we are going to compare the expression of the different orthologs of <code>NCDN</code> for Xenopus, Human, mouse, rat, guinea pig and macaque.</p> <p>First, gather the Ensembl identifiers for those genes by looking at the orthologs tab!</p> <ul> <li>Rat (<code>ENSRNOG00000011751</code>)</li> <li>Xenopus (<code>ENSXETG00000009669</code>)</li> <li>Human (<code>ENSG00000020129</code>)</li> <li>Mouse (<code>ENSMUSG00000028833</code>)</li> <li>Guinea pig (<code>ENSCPOG00000023962</code>)</li> <li>Macaque (<code>ENSMMUG00000019812</code>).</li> </ul> <p>We will learn to use Bgee expression comparison tool in order to gain novel insights on <code>NCDN</code> anatomical expression. To do this, click on the Analysis section of the top toolbar of Bgee and then on Expression comparison.</p> <p>Fill the orthologs identifiers in the gene list, with one gene per line and click the search button to launch Bgee\u2019s expression comparison tool.</p> <p>You will obtain the following results:</p> <p>Question: Looking at the max expression scores, do the results seem consistent with the anatomical localization of <code>NCDN</code> expression when looking at individual species?</p> Answer <p>Yes, the results are highly consistent, again we can see that <code>NCDN</code> expression is extremely highly expressed in the same tissues (mainly brain) throughout the given species.</p> <p>The conservation score represents the ratio between genes being called present in the tissue and the total number of genes. In our case since we only used orthologs, this value gives us the ratio between species which have <code>NCDN</code> expressed in that tissue divided by the total number of species for which we have data in that condition (maximum 6).</p> <p>Question: With the help of the conservation score, can you see for which species and tissue there is a qualitative difference in the expression of <code>NCDN</code>?</p> Answer <p>Yes, we can see that Xenopus tropicalis has lost expression of this gene in spleen and small intestine wherehas its expression remains relatively high in the other species.</p>"},{"location":"course_material/day3/4_group_function/","title":"Finding information about function of a group of genes","text":""},{"location":"course_material/day3/4_group_function/#aim","title":"Aim","text":"<p>Learn to explore the function of a set of genes as a group using GO enrichment, TopAnat and Bgee expression values.</p>"},{"location":"course_material/day3/4_group_function/#learning-outcomes","title":"Learning outcomes","text":"<ul> <li>What can a GO enrichment analysis tell us about the function of a set of genes of interest?</li> <li>What can TopAnat tell us about it?</li> <li>What can we learn on gene expression evolution by clustering expression values?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course_material/day3/4_group_function/#go-enrichment","title":"GO enrichment","text":"<p>The first thing we can do to study the function of these genes as a set is a GO enrichment analysis.

We also see some biological process specific of birds. The opossum enriched GO term list is much more similar to that of human. We see a lot of developmental and core processes. No opossum-specific biological process can be seen and, in general, the therms are less specific</li> <li>The human case is clearly the most detailed. Opossum annotation seems to be mainly retrieved from that of other mammal species, this is why we don\u2019t see a lot of specificity in GO terms and none specific of opossum. Chicken annotation has some bird-specific terms but showed less essential processes for the same group of orthologous genes. This might suggest that the chicken annotation is not based on that of other model species, but it is a bit incomplete and biased towards the most studied processes in this species</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course_material/day3/4_group_function/#extra-questions-if-time-permits","title":"Extra questions if time permits","text":"<p>Do a GO enrichment analysis with the list of human genes but this time select the <code>GO molecular function complete</code> list of GO terms.

Nevertheless, the ones that are enriched are related to basic processes like expected. This point towards the one-to-one orthologs being overall enriched in biological processes as a hole more than enriched in more specific molecular functions</li> <li>The molecular function GO terms are useful when trying to understand the molecular pathways and metabolic processes enriched in a group of genes.

It is really similar in methodology to the GO enrichment that you just did but instead of using Gene Ontology terms, it is based on Anatomical entities or, in other words, on tissues or organs (more specifically, on Uberon identifiers). This tool will be able to tell us in which anatomical entities the genes in our set are being more expressed compared to a background set of genes.</p> <p>To access the tool in Bgee\u2019s website, please go to the top <code>Analysis</code> section of the top toolbar and click on <code>TopAnat: Expression enrichment analysis</code> (or just click on the red button <code>Expression enrichment analysis</code> on the homepage).

Therefore, they seem to indeed be a bit more tissue specific.</p> <p>Try to do the same steps for other species such as Macaque or Opossum.</p> <p>Question: Do you get similar results? Do you get more similar results between species than when comparing with autism spectrum results?</p> Answer <p>Yes, we do get more similar results than when comparing with autism spectrum genes since the list is composed of genes for which we have orthologs in the different species and orthologs tend to have more similar tissue expression among each other than compared to random autism genes.</p>"},{"location":"course_material/day3/4_group_function/#clustering-of-homologous-organ-expression-in-several-species","title":"Clustering of homologous organ expression in several species","text":"<p>For this step, we are going to do a principal component analysis of the expression values for the multiple conditions and species.
